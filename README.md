Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project


## Cleaning up the Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Dataset

Scripts:

* 'tidy_data_set.txt'
* 'run_analysis.R'
* 'CodeBook.md'
* 'README.md'

The tidy_data_set.txt file is a result of cleaning up the raw data available in 

http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones. 

In order to get this output, some transformations were made to the raw data. This process' script is in the run_analysis.R file. The working directory set in R should be the "UCI HAR Dataset" folder. 

A code book that describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or work performed to clean up the data was written and called CodeBook.md.
